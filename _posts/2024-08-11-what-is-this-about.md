title: "What is this about?"
---

Hey there! I'll be using this blog to keep track of everything I'll be studying through my journey. I'll be posting LeetCodes (mostly hards), system design notions and documentation/technical details about my side projects. 


## Who am I
I'm a Software Engineer currently employed by a consulting firm ([Reply](https://www.reply.com/it)). I mainly deal with Backend, more specifically using PHP, Java and AWS. 

## How did I build this blog
This archive has been built using Jekyll (check out the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)) and the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/), hosting everything on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).
